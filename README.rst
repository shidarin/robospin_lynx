`Original photography`_ for this theme is by `Pete Slater`_. Modifications have
been made to his original work.

Installation
------------

The simplest installation method is through git, from within your attract
mode layout folder::

    git clone https://github.com/shidarin/robospin_lynx.git

This will create a `robospin_lynx` folder inside your layout folder, and 
you can now select `robospin_lynx` as a theme for a display.

You can also unzip archives from the `release page`_ into a `robospin_lynx`
folder in your layout folder, and it will do the same thing without git.

Usage
-----

`robospin_lynx` uses a new art type, `cart` to display cartridges besides 
any flyer (box) art. If you wish to display carts, you must create a new 
art entry from the emulator settings window.

Options
-------

`robospin_lynx` exposes the following options:

    * SpinWheel: The artwork to spin
    * Mask: Darkens the area behind the SpinWheel
    * Transition Time: Time in milliseconds for wheel spin.
    * Dusty Screen: Adds realistic dust to the screen overlay.

Changelog
---------
